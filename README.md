AI-Powered Assistive Solution for Visually Impaired Individuals
This project leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to assist visually impaired individuals in perceiving and interacting with their surroundings. The solution provides real-time scene understanding, text-to-speech conversion, object detection, and other assistive functionalities using Generative AI and Streamlit.

🌟 Key Features
1.Real-Time Scene Understanding

Generates a descriptive textual interpretation of the uploaded image to help users understand the scene effectively.
Powered by Google Vision API and Langchain for detailed analysis.
2.Text-to-Speech Conversion

Extracts text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques.
Converts the extracted text into audible speech using PyTTSx3 for seamless content accessibility.
3.Object and Obstacle Detection (Optional)

Identifies objects or obstacles within the image, providing insights to enhance user safety and situational awareness.
User-Friendly Interface

Developed using Streamlit for an interactive and accessible experience.
🛠 Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Streamlit: For building a user-friendly web application.
Langchain: Used for generating detailed interpretations of the scene.
Google Vision API: For advanced image analysis and object detection.
Pytesseract: For OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from images.
Pyttsx3: For text-to-speech functionality.
